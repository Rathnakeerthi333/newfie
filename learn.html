      <h3>Bodybuilding</h3>
      <p>Bodybuilding focuses on building muscle size and strength through structured weight training. It requires progressive overload, compound lifts (like squats, bench press, deadlifts), and high-protein nutrition to support muscle recovery and growth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Athlete Training</h3>
      <p>Athlete training improves speed, agility, stamina, and strength for sports performance. Workouts include sprint drills, plyometrics, explosive lifts, and endurance training. It’s designed to increase overall athletic performance and prevent injuries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Weight Loss</h3>
      <p>Weight loss is achieved by creating a calorie deficit through exercise and diet. Cardio (running, cycling, HIIT) helps burn calories, while strength training preserves lean muscle. Balanced nutrition with fewer processed foods is key for sustainable results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Yoga & Flexibility</h3>
      <p>Yoga combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to improve flexibility, strength, and mental focus. It reduces stress, increases mobility, and enhances overall body balance. Great for recovery and long-term wellness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Nutrition</h3>
      <p>Nutrition fuels fitness goals. A balanced diet with proteins, healthy carbs, fats, vitamins, and minerals is essential. For muscle gain → high protein + surplus calories. For fat loss → controlled calories with clean eating. Hydration and sleep also matter.</p>
